# Component library template
## Setup
This template can be used to create a component library repository using stencilJS.

When you created your own repository with this template please follow the following instructions and change this readme according to your project setup afterwards.

#### 1. After installing the packages, use `npm run init` to initialize your project. You can customize the preview here: .storybook/manager.js
#### 2. Create new components with `npm run generate` - Don't forget to use a dash in the component's name! There is already an example component in the components folder where we used Storybook Knobs and Faker, to give you an idea :)
#### 3. Start the build and serve process with `npm start`.

## Features
### Tests
Run `test:generate-output` before running `npm start` to see the test results for the generated component tests in the preview.

### Configure your Github Repository by code
We provide some Github Repository configuration standards, like recommended branch projection settings, with this template. You can find the configuration in .github/settings.yml if you want this settings be applied to your Github repository, install the Github Settings app for your repository: https://github.com/apps/settings. The app will read the settings.yml automatically and apply the settings to your repository. Afterwards you can add or customize settings.yml according to your preferences.
